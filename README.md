This is code for our vending machine project. 
It consists of data collection, training, and testing. Most of this code is provided by NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) code. 
It is designed to be run on the Jetson Nano in conjunction with the detailed instructions provided in the online DLI course pages. 

The Jetson Nano handles the ai part of the machine. It will give a signal to the arduino. The arduino controls the motors inside the vending machine.

There is also code written specifically for the arduino which is in charge of operating the motors.

Parts list:
  Arduino Uno
  3 vex two wire motors(393)
  3 vex bumper switches
  2 nine volts bateries
  2 L293N chips
  Jetson Orin Nano
  Logitech camera C270
